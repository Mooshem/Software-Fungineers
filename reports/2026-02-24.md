# Week 7: Continuing Implementation, Bug Fixes, and Early Unit Tests

## Team Report
**Goals that were planned for week 7:**
- Finish implementation of player's interactions (placing blocks, movement, breaking blocks)
- Finish implementation of blocks
- Start early beta implementations of puzzle design
- Use integration testing in a test world to ensure no bugs occur
- Retain a 0% regression rate for bugs (bug reports)

**Team Progress and Issues:**
- Blocks are much more complicated to implement
- Texture issues are apparent
- Still figuring out wiring system for implementation
- Figured out CI pipeline for MacOS and Windows exports
- Player's block placement, breaking, and movement are mostly finished and ready for beta test

**Goals planned for week 8:**
- Finish implementation of blocks
- Start early beta level creation
- Implement test cases with at least 80% statement coverage
- Begin brainstorming mutation testing strategies
- Retain 0% regression rate for bugs

## Contribution of Individual Members:
**Donovan Thach:**
**Goals that were planned for week 7**
- Design a character model other than the template we have
- Help Cash with block implementation if necessary
- Set hard deadlines for when certain objects or classes need to be finished
- Find a way to implement unit test cases to test during week 8
- Improve the test world to start doing stress testing

**Individual Progress and Issues:**
- Character model got moved to a stretch goal for week 10; not necessary
- Started variable block progress
- Not much was done for the project, had to work on other things
- Needed to fix bug reports after feedback

**Plans for week 8:**
- Start and finish variable block 
- Start making a new block variation
- Discuss plans for what should be considered stretch goal and what should be considered a requirement
