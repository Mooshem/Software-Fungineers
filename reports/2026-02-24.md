# Week 7: Continuing Implementation, Bug Fixes, and Early Unit Tests

## Team Report
**Goals that were planned for week 7:**
- Finish implementation of player's interactions (placing blocks, movement, breaking blocks)
- Finish implementation of blocks
- Start early beta implementations of puzzle design
- Use integration testing in a test world to ensure no bugs occur
- Retain a 0% regression rate for bugs (bug reports)

**Team Progress and Issues:**
- Blocks are much more complicated to implement
- Texture issues are apparent
- Still figuring out wiring system for implementation
- Figured out CI pipeline for MacOS and Windows exports
- Player's block placement, breaking, and movement are mostly finished and ready for beta test

**Goals planned for week 8:**
- Finish implementation of blocks
- Start early beta level creation
- Implement test cases with at least 80% statement coverage
- Begin brainstorming mutation testing strategies
- Retain 0% regression rate for bugs

## Contribution of Individual Members:
**Donovan Thach:**
**Goals that were planned for week 7**
- Design a character model other than the template we have
- Help Cash with block implementation if necessary
- Set hard deadlines for when certain objects or classes need to be finished
- Find a way to implement unit test cases to test during week 8
- Improve the test world to start doing stress testing

**Individual Progress and Issues:**
- Character model got moved to a stretch goal for week 10; not necessary
- Started variable block progress
- Not much was done for the project, had to work on other things
- Needed to fix bug reports after feedback

**Plans for week 8:**
- Start and finish variable block 
- Start making a new block variation
- Discuss plans for what should be considered stretch goal and what should be considered a requirement

**Daniel Martin:**
**Goals that were planned for week 7**
- Finish 5 more puzzle designs
- Start designing assets to bring puzzle designs into the game

**Individual Progress and Issues:**
- Fully designed sandbox level and added level assets
- Implemented CICD pipeline with github actions
- Added GUT (Godot unit testing) to our project for our test plan, and wrote a suite of tests for player functions

**Plans for week 8:**
- Finish implementing levels using sandbox level as a template
- Add ~20 more tests to the suite
- Continue aiding development of other features as needed

**Zheng Chen**  
**Goals that were planned for week 7**  
- Have menu transitions to align with updated gameplay scene  
- Add a basic Instructions/Settings panel  
- Continue improving UI polish (font consistency and alignment)  
- Assist with integration testing in the test world  

**Individual Progress and Issues:**  
- Implemented menu transitions and refined the menu ui including animations  
- Added placeholder settings button as well as pause menu while in-game  
- Added new grass texture to existing sandbox  
- Implemented CI for GUT  
- Added test suites for hotbar, writing, and player  

**Plans for week 8:**  
- Add more tests to the suite as we develope more features.  
- Aid in developement on specific blocks such as incrementor or signal system.
