# Week 4: Architecture and Design 

## Team report 
**Goals planned for this week:** 
* Complete the Living Document sections for Architecture and Design (2 days)
* Create a high-level flowchart of the logic (1 day)
* Set up the base Godot project and organize the folder structure in GitHub (1 day)

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What team did:** Finalized the Software Architecture and chose an Event-Driven pattern using Godot. 
* **What worked:** The design of our character and scenes worked, and movement is heading in the right direction
* **What our team learned:** Our team learned about implementing textures and user-friendly visuals
* **Where team had trouble:** Our team had trouble implementing correct assets and sprites, but we overcame that obstacle

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Configure the C++ build environment for all team members (2 days)
* Create a basic 3D "Test Scene" with a floor and basic lighting (1 day)
* Make the JSON schema for saving/loading level progress (1 day)

## Contributions of individual team members

**Zheng Chen:**
**Goals planned for this week:** 
* Research 3D UI to understand how players will select blocks (2 days)
* Create mockup for the main menu screen (1 day)
* Write up or make a style guide for block colors and textures (1 day)

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What I did:** Experimented with the Godot Editor and imported initial environmental assets.
* **What worked:** Successfully applied and tiled a grass texture to a 3D mesh to test visual scale.
* **What I learned:** I learned how Godot handles materials for 3D objects.
* **Where I had trouble:** Learning the Godot node hierarchy and how to properly use UI elements to a 3D camera.

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Build a functional "Prototype Menu" in Godot with a 'Play' and 'Exit' button (2 days)
* Refine the grass texture, or make a better one (1 day)

**Cash Limberg:**
**Goals planned for this week:** 
* Begin work on blocks and functionality (3 day)
* Work on puzzles that could challenge a user (2 days)
* Workshop stretch goals (2 days)

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What I did:** Worked with github and Godot to begin writing code and implementation
* **What worked:** Developed the 3D environment
* **What I learned:** Scalability for this project, and limiting unnecessary processing
* **Where I had trouble:** Working with scalability and not creating too challenging of a 3D environment

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Design a block (2 days)
* Allow the user to place and remove blocks (2 days)


**Daniel Martin:**
**Goals planned for this week:** 
* Implement block classes (3 day)
* Help design class architecture with Cash (3 day)
* Help with visuals (textures, assets, etc.) as needed ( 2 days )

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What I did:** Met with team to discuss block architecture and how classes should be built
* **What worked:** Working class diagram, still needs improvements, but generally functional
* **What I learned:** Introduction to pixel art through making textures
* **Where I had trouble:** Getting a concrete definition for block implementation, and how they will be implemented.

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Design 10 puzzles (2 days)
* Design and implement game graphics (2 days)
