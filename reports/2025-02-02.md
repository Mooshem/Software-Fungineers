# Team Report
## Goal
For this week, we are tasked to finish up our architecture and desigin phase, and slowly move towards beginning our implementation
phase.  

## Progress and Issues
So far, some templates have been made for the project as our team has begun the implementation phase, but a lot of it needs more
refinement and changes to stay unique.  

## Future Plans
By February 5th, our team will have finished all architecture and design, and by February 10th, we will have completed out Mid-Term
Presentation slides and will have refined the templates, officially kickstarting our implementation process.
