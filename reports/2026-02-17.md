# Week 6: Implementation and Early Testing Strategies

## Team Report
**Goals that were planned for week 6:**
- Finish slides before presentation
- Practice presentation
- Continue implementation with test cases in mind

**Team Progress and Issues:**
- Presentation material had to be changed due to clarification on requirements
- Progress is still stagnant, needs to be quicker and faster
- Test cases seem harder to implement, especially unit tests for Godot's gdscripts

**Goals planned for week 7:**
- Finish implementation of player's interactions (placing blocks, movement, breaking blocks)
- Finish implementation of blocks
- Start early beta implementations of puzzle design
- Use integration testing in a test world to ensure no bugs occur
- Retain a 0% regression rate for bugs (bug reports)

## Contributions of Individual Members:
**Cash Limberg:**
**Goals that were planned for week 6:**
- Complete block implementation
- Fix user movement
- Add textures to block

**Individual Progress and Issues:**
- Complete slides for presentation

**Donovan Thach:**  
**Goals that were planned for week 6:**
- Complete testing slides
- Fix gdscripts on certain bugs and change living document to match use case guidelines
- Manage and engage team for their own changes to the living document

**Individual Progress and Issues:**
- Although one gdscript has been made so far, the game has already ran into 3 separate bugs
- Fixed 3 bugs pertaining to player movement, block placement, and alignment of the grid system
- Still haven't figured out a character design for the player
- Bug reports still need work

**Plans for week 7:**
- Design a character model other than the template we have
- Help Cash with block implementation if necessary
- Set hard deadlines for when certain objects or classes need to be finished
- Find a way to implement unit test cases to test during week 8
- Improve the test world to start doing stress testing (validation testing)


**Daniel Martin:**  
**Goals that were planned for week 6:**
- Finish 5 more puzzle designs
- Start designing assets to bring puzzle designs into the game

**Individual Progress and Issues:**
- Completed 5 more puzzle designs, now have 10 total
- Helped playtest current progress
- Two challenging midterms last week, so wasn't able to make much progress

**Plans for week 7:**
- Implement different block types with Cash
- Make required assets for my level designs
- Help out with visuals / testing if needed  

**Zheng Chen:**   
**Goals that were planned for week 6:**  
- Finalize menu design based on mock designs  
- Implement the functional “Prototype Menu” with ‘Play’ and ‘Exit’ buttons  
- Refine the grass texture  

**Individual Progress and Issues:**  
- Implemented a working Prototype Menu scene with functional buttons  
- Adjusted UI layout and connected scene transitions properly  
- Improved overall visual consistency of the environment  
- UI scaling across resolutions took longer than expected  
- Integration with unfinished gameplay systems is weird and may require later adjustments  

**Plans for week 7:**  
- Have menu transitions to align with updated gameplay scene  
- Add a basic Instructions/Settings panel  
- Continue improving UI polish (font consistency and alignment)  
- Assist with integration testing in the test world
