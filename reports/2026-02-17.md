# Week 6: Implementation and Early Testing Strategies

## Team Report
**Goals that were planned for week 6:**
- Finish slides before presentation
- Practice presentation
- Continue implementation with test cases in mind

**Team Progress and Issues:**
- Presentation material had to be changed due to clarification on requirements
- Progress is still stagnant, needs to be quicker and faster
- Test cases seem harder to implement, especially unit tests for Godot's gdscripts

**Goals planned for week 7:**
- Finish implementation of player's interactions (placing blocks, movement, breaking blocks)
- Finish implementation of blocks
- Start early beta implementations of puzzle design
- Use integration testing in a test world to ensure no bugs occur
- Retain a 0% regression rate for bugs (bug reports)

## Contributions of Individual Members:

**Donovan Thach:**  
**Goals that were planned for week 6:**
- Complete testing slides
- Fix gdscripts on certain bugs and change living document to match use case guidelines
- Manage and engage team for their own changes to the living document

**Individual Progress and Issues:**
- Although one gdscript has been made so far, the game has already ran into 3 separate bugs
- Fixed 3 bugs pertaining to player movement, block placement, and alignment of the grid system
- Still haven't figured out a character design for the player
- Bug reports still need work

**Plans for week 7:**
- Design a character model other than the template we have
- Help Cash with block implementation if necessary
- Set hard deadlines for when certain objects or classes need to be finished
- Find a way to implement unit test cases to test during week 8
- Improve the test world to start doing stress testing (validation testing)
