# Week 3: Requirements Elicitation

## Team report 
**Goals planned for this week:** None - Initial week

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What team did:** Settled on the "Coding Cubed" project idea and finalized the core educational goals.
* **What worked:** Brainstorming session to identify common student pitfalls in intro CS classes.
* **What team learned:** Pick the problem first visualization of logic, then design the solution of 3D block game.
* **Where team had trouble:** Narrowing down the project scope to be deliverable within 10 weeks.

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Complete full Requirement Analysis document (2 days)
* Finalize the High-Level Software Architecture pattern (1 day)
* Create initial 3D environment (3 days)

## Contributions of individual team members

**Zheng Chen:**
**Goals planned for this week:** None - Initial week

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What I did:** Mapped out the conceptual design for specific programming blocks. 
* **What worked:** Breaking down a "For Loop" into modular 3D components (init, condition, increment).
* **What I learned:** Identified that visual lines / wires are needed to represent logic flow so users understand block connections.
* **Where I had trouble:** Determining the technical requirements for nesting blocks inside a loop structure.

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Research 3D UI implementation in Godot (2 days)
* Create placeholder textures for environmental assets (1 day)
* Draft mockup for the main menu and puzzle selection screen (2 days)
