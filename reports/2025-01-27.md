# Team Report
## Goal

The main goal of this week is to come up with some architecture and design for our project. Not only that, we will begin
doing early designs by using the event-driven architecture pattern.

## Progress and Issues

We are to finish the architecture and designing phase of the project, as well as start creating project templates and
assets to be used later.

## Future Plans

By the beginning of next week, our team will have started working on ways to implement functions into blocks to add to 
the scene of our project, and also start coming up with intuitive puzzles.
