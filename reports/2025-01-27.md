# Week 3: Requirements Elicitation

## Team report 
**Goals planned for this week:** None - Initial week

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What team did:** Settled on the "Coding Cubed" project idea and finalized the core educational goals.
* **What worked:** Brainstorming session to identify common student pitfalls in intro CS classes.
* **What team learned:** Pick the problem first visualization of logic, then design the solution of 3D block game.
* **Where team had trouble:** Narrowing down the project scope to be deliverable within 10 weeks.

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Complete full Requirement Analysis document (2 days)
* Finalize the High-Level Software Architecture pattern (1 day)
* Create initial 3D environment (3 days)

## Contributions of individual team members

**Zheng Chen:**
**Goals planned for this week:** None - Initial week

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What I did:** Mapped out the conceptual design for specific programming blocks. 
* **What worked:** Breaking down a "For Loop" into modular 3D components (init, condition, increment).
* **What I learned:** Identified that visual lines / wires are needed to represent logic flow so users understand block connections.
* **Where I had trouble:** Determining the technical requirements for nesting blocks inside a loop structure.

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Research 3D UI implementation in Godot (2 days)
* Create placeholder textures for environmental assets (1 day)
* Draft mockup for the main menu and puzzle selection screen (2 days)

**Cash Limberg:** 

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What I did:** Worked on the design and architecture of the software 
* **What worked:** Designing the For loop and functions, working on character and scene
* **What I learned:** What works as a stretch goal and as a primary goal, and what is important to include in the software
* **Where I had trouble:** Determining what to implement and how to timeline it all. 

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Finish character design and movement (2 days)
* Implement placing and removing blocks (2 days)
* Work on sprites and color schema (2 days)

**Daniel Martin:** 

**Team progress and issues:**
* **What I did:** Worked on the curriculum and design of blocks for the game
* **What worked:** Meeting with team to discuss concepts to be taught and creating a simple floor texture
* **What I learned:** Implementation is our main goal right now. We've discussed all of teh plans, but need to get real progress implementing the game
* **Where I had trouble:** Understanding the godot flow when working as a team (integration with git) and figuring out how blocks would work.

**Goals planned for next week:**
* Work on implementing classes (specifically each individual block) (3 days)
* Design first few puzzles (2 days)
* Help work on graphics (textures, assets, etc.) as needed (2 days)
