# Team Report
## Goal

The main goal of this week is to come up with some architecture and design for our project. Not only that, we will begin
doing early designs by using the event-driven architecture pattern.

## Progress and Issues

We are to finish the architecture and designing phase of the project, as well as start creating project templates and
assets to be used later.

## Future Plans

By the beginning of next week, our team will have started working on ways to implement functions into blocks to add to 
the scene of our project, and also start coming up with intuitive puzzles.
# Contributions
## Goal

Our goal is to finalize concepts to be taught and to solidify the main game loop. We will do this by writing down a curriculum and discussing our plans for classes, which blocks we need to implement etc. We also want to start development of the game environment with a player character, scene, basic movement, etc.

## Progress and Issues

We've continued meeting regularly and finalizing our plans for the project. We've created our godot project, and begun working on assets as well as some textures.

## Future Plans

We plan on continuing to develop the game environment so that everyone can participate in development with a solid foundation. We also plan on implementing the classes we discussed as well as continuing to build the required assets for our game.
