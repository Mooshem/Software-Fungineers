The problem that our team is solving is teaching new users how to program. Our unique way of solving this problem is relating these users towards something that they are familiar with; video games.

The only problems we faced this week was finalizing what our project would be about. We started with a few different ideas that didn't make the cut before we settled on Coding Cubed. We learned that we needed a more grounded, personal project that solves a direct problem that we can see. What helped us with this is picking the problem first, and then designing the solution.

Future Plans

By Monday, January 26th, our team plans on having finished the Requirements Analysis step of Software Engineering, and we will have begun on the design stage. Our whole team is responsible for presenting our project to our class on Tuesday, January 20th, but once that is done we will deligate tasks as suported by our team roles. Donovan Thach is our project manager, meaning that he is in charge of submitting assignments and ensuring good workflow between the team, plus helping out where ever he is needed. Zheng Chen will work on UX / Quality Design, meaning he will be responsible in the design stage to framework our code and styles. Cash Limberg is our lead developer, meaning that he will work on design and implementation, and keep the project in scope for our programming requirements. Daniel Martin is our Software Architecture, meaning that he will be vital in the design stage, as he is going to help push us towards a risk-free architecture for our software.

Our team has had little to no problems delegating team work or finding time to meet with all four of us. We have meetings for this class at least once a week, on Tuesdays from 6pm-9pm. In these meetings, we have talked about our overall plans for this project and what we hope to achieve for it. All of our team members have shown up to these meetings, and we have all done a respectable amount of work on the project individually.

Donovan Thach is going to work on his section of the slides for our presentation, and ensure that our github is constantly up to date. This includes ensuring our weekly reports are accurate and honest, and our github is organized in compliance with the requirements of the class. Zheng Chen is going to also work on his slides, and work on research of 3D game design and how properly implement it with our project. Cash Limberg is going to work on his slides, and perform research about the benefits of learning how to prorgram in a 3D environment. Daniel Martin is going to work on his slides, and start an early look at the design stage of our project. He will bring these design ideas to our next meeting to ensure that the group is informed on what we need to do.
