Project Description
===================================================================   

    //////////////////
    Abstract
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our team is developing a 3D game simulation for visualizing and practicing
        coding. We will create a 3D space for users to learn how to code, using blocks
        and lines as functions and commands. This will allow a generation that grew up 
        playing videogames to learn how to program in an environment that they are
        familiar with.

    //////////////////
    Goal
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The problem that our team is solving is teaching new users how to program. Our
        unique way of solving this problem is relating these users towards something that
        they are familiar with; video games. 

    //////////////////
    Current Practice
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Currently, learning how to code stems from lectures and hands-off teaching. Our aim 
        is to revolutionize this process, allowing people to learn in an effecient manner.

    //////////////////
    Novelty
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our approach is novel because it’s similar to a video game. This generation of students 
        has grown up playing video games, and would likely find it more helpful than current options.

    //////////////////
    Effects
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Beginners to programming would find it useful to visualize what is actually 
        happening with their code. The majority of our team works as TA’s, and we’ve 
        noticed a gap in fundamental knowledge that we believe visualization can help 
        bridge.

    //////////////////
    Use Case
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        CL - A user wants to get into programming, but they are unsure where to start. They will
             use our game to learn how programming 

            Actor: Cranjis McBasketball
            Triggers: Mr McBasketball doesn't know where to start learning programming, and wants 
                      something not overwhelming.
            Preconditions: 
                - Mr McBasketball has a need for learning programming
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
                - Mr McBasketball successfully learns the fundamentals of programming so he can
                  apply it to a language of his choice
                - Mr McBasketball successfully completes the puzzles offered in the game
            List of steps (success scenario): 
                1. Mr McBasketball opens the game
                2. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 1
                3. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 2
                4. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 3
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario:
                - Mr McBasketball already understands functions, so he stops at puzzle 2
                - Mr McBasketball replays a puzzle that he thinks he could solve better
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
                - Mr McBasketball does not complete puzzle 1, which doesn't allow him to 
                  continue to puzzle 2

        ZC - A user has tried programming before, but they can't understand how their code works. 
             They will use the game to learn how their code works and implement this 
             knowledge into real-world programming.

            Actor: Alvin Chipmunk, a high school student who has tried to learn programming through
            YouTube tutorials
            Triggers: Alvin writes code that compiles but doesn't produce expected results, leading to frustration
            Preconditions: 
                - Alvin has basic knowledge of programming syntax like variables
                - Alvin has the game installed and accessible
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
                - Alvin successfully visualizes how loops and conditionals execute step by step
                - Alvin understands why his previous code didn't work as expected
                - Alvin can apply this visualization knowledge to debug real code
            List of steps (success scenario): 
                - Alvin opens the game and selects a "Loop Visualization" puzzle
                - Alvin places blocks to build a for-loop structure
                - Alvin connects conditional blocks within the loop
                - Alvin runs the game and watches the 3D visualization execute each step at a time
                - Alvin observes how the loop counter changes and how conditionals affect execution flow
                - Alvin pauses execution at key points to examine block states
                - Alvin completes the puzzle and gains understanding of loop mechanics
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
                - Alvin replays the visualization at different speeds to better understand quick executions
                - Alvin modifies the puzzle parameters to test edge cases
                - Alvin uses the knowledge to fix a bug in his actual code
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
                - Alvin cant understand the block metaphor and needs to complete a tutorial first
                - The visualization is too fast or slow and Alvin can't adjust the speed
                - Alvin's computer doesn't meet the minimum requirements and the game lags, preventing smooth visualization

        DT - A user doesn't learn well by sitting through tutorials and lectures, and wants to 
             begin writing programs. The user will use our game to teach themselves how to 
             program in a way that works for their brain. 

            Actor: Yin Chen
            Triggers: 
                - Yin keeps watching coding materials, wanting to learn programming at a 
                  young age, but all tutorial videos are unamusing and disinteresting.
            Preconditions: 
                - Yin wants an interactive way, preferably a game, where he can learn how
                  to program.
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
                - Yin finds it fun and challenging to complete each puzzle, learning the 
                  basics along the way
            List of steps (success scenario): 
                1. Yin downloads the game and plays it
                2. Yin works through trial and error, seeing how he directly changes the
                   result and seeing how each change he makes affects the program
                3. Yin continues playing the game, wanting to learn more about programming
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
                - Yin uses the game to help him get through online tutorials much easier
                  due to a larger amount of background knowledge on programming
                - Yin begins to widen his programming knowledge at a much earlier age than
                  others might
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
                - Yin can't solve any puzzles that the game prevents, which might shut him
                  out from programming altogether
                - Yin might not find the game interesting enough to continue playing/learning

        DM - A user wants to switch careers, but doesn't have time to enroll in classes to learn
             how to program. The user will use our game to teach themselves how to program in their
             free time.

            Actor: Hunter D. Killingson, A busy 30 year old martial arts instructor, who wants to become a software engineer
            Triggers: Hunter is very busy managing his gym and can't afford to spend much time taking intro coding classes.
            Preconditions: Hunter wants a quick and fun way to learn coding concepts that feels less like work, and more like a game.
            Postconditions (success scenario): Hunter enjoys the game-like structure and sees it as an engaging and educational way to kickstart his career change.
            List of steps (success scenario):
             - Hunter opens the game and plays the first level of the story mode.
             - The first level teaches him what variables are in an engaging way.
             - Hunter completes the level relatively quickly and enjoys the format of the game.
             - Hunter continues playing through levels in his free time, eventually learning about other concepts like loops, recursion, functions.
             - Hunter's interest in coding grows, and he now feels more comfortable switching to a textual language, and furthering his education.
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
             - Hunter plays the game alongside a course for a textual languages to better grasp the textual language
             - Hunter plays in the "sandbox" mode to explore what programming has to offer, and if it might be a good choice for his career
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
             - The game is too hard, and Hunter is pushed away from programming.
             - The levels are too time-consuming, and Hunter is too busy to dive deep into the game.

    //////////////////
    Non-Functional Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The program will run without lagging, creating a seamless user experience.

        The program will start withen 3 seconds of running the program.

        The program will be able to support 1 user.

        New users must be able to complete the first puzzle within 10 minutes.

        Must run on integrated graphics cards.

    //////////////////
    External Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The application must run on Windows 10/11

        All third-party libraries and 3D graphics frameworks used must have permissive open-source 
        licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, or similar) to allow free distribution to educational institutions
        
        The programming concepts taught (variables, conditionals, loops, functions) must align with standard 
        CS curriculum frameworks

    //////////////////
    Technical Approach
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our team intends on using a technical 3D graphics software, Godot,
        to complete this project. We will also be using Visual Studio code for 
        writing the program. 

    //////////////////
    Risks
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The largest risk that our team forsees is not fully being able to distinguish 
        conditional statements for a user to distinguish it from other conditional 
        statements. To solve this risk we will focus on understandable UX design.

    Team Process Description
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    
    Software Toolset:

        Tool: Godot 
        Justification: Open-source 3D game engine with MIT license meeting our external requirements. 
            It also has built-in 3D tools and visual scripting.

        Tool: Visual Studio Code
        Justification: IDE we're familiar with, and has GDScript extensions and version control integration.

        Tool: GitHub
        Justification: Essential for team collaboration. Provides issue tracking and project management tools.

    Team Member Roles:

        Donovan Thach - Project Manager
            Why this role is needed: Big projects with tight deadlines requires someone to ensure that the team
                not only stays on track, but also that the project will be deliverable by the assumed date that
                it is due.
            Why Donovan is suited: Experience with many teams that required leadership or a constant drive.

        Zheng Chen - UX/Design Lead and Quality Assurance
            Why this role is needed: Educational games require intuitive interfaces so users focus on
                learning programming concepts rather than struggling with controls.
            Why Zheng is suited: Experience with TAing reveals and provides direct insight to common student
                struggles with programming concepts.

        Cash Limberg - Lead Developer
            Why this role is needed: We need a lead developer due to the challenge of developing this specific
                game, and the challenges that it poses to work with a group of people. Giving the group a lead 
                developer allows for all the programmers in the group to be directed and understand their  
                job in the team.
            Why Cash is suited: Cash has TAed before, leading a group of people through complex coding problems
                and solutions. Cash has demonstrated that he is capable of understanding others' programs, and 
                quickly diagnosing potential risks that those problems can cause if left untreated.


        Daniel Martin - Educational Game Design Lead
            Why this role is needed: As an educational game, we need to ensure that the content is appropriate.
                This means that the overall game loop must be engaging, but more importantly, it needs to
                actually teach players coding fundamentals. This role ensure that both of those criteria is met.
            Why Daniel is suited: Daniel is a ULA for intro CS classes, and has experience with common pitfalls
                that trap beginner programers. Through this experience, Daniel has learned what students typically
                struggle with and what needs to be emphasized for the game to be educational.

    Weekly Schedule and Milestones

        Week 4:
            Donovan: Solidify the deliverables, give the team the requirements necessary to start the project, align the
                        team on certain user stories each of them will be working towards, and identify potential 
                        roadblocks that the team might face in the future.
            Zheng: Complete UI mockups for main menu and puzzle interface. User flow diagram for first puzzle completed.
            Cash: Begin development and design process with Daniel. Framework classes that will be required for this project.
            Daniel: Design a "curriculum" that teaches the concepts we want to teach. Concepts will be discussed this week.

            Donovan: Start weekly check-ups with team to ensure project will be deliverable, start weekly meetings to 
                        keep the whole team in check and ensure that the design phase is clear. Also, begin designing
                        fundamental and entertaining puzzles to be used in conjunction with UI.
            Zheng: Basic UI implemented in Godot. Main menu functional with working buttons.
            Cash: Have classes finalized, including member variables and functions. Draft file implementation of said 
                        classes.
            Daniel: Finalize block designs. What blocks do we need? What will they do? How will they interact with each other? etc.

        Week 6:
            Donovan: Resolve any complications that resulted from the week prior and work with team members to continue
                        progress.
            Zheng: Block placement UI functional - visual feedback for valid/invalid placement working.
            Cash: Develop Block placement, and have user movement and block placing completed. Draft block implementations.
            Daniel: Plan levels that follow curriculum plan and are an appropriate challenge level

        Week 7:
            Donovan: Overall QA meeting 1, collect and create a checklist for any bugs found.
            Zheng: QA testing complete for puzzle 1. Bug list documented with priorities assigned.
            Cash: Block implementation should be finalized. Begin the development of the puzzles. 
            Daniel: Implement levels to the game and have other team members play test to make sure they are the right difficulty

         Week 8:
            Donovan: Ensure members with bugs aligning to their roles have been resolved and ensure project scope will
                        be within the deadline.
            Zheng: UI polish and refinements based on Week 6 playtest feedback. All visual elements finalized.
            Cash: Ensure all code is working seamlessly. Fix potential bug problems and ensure that all test cases
                        and use cases are passed. Work on tutorial system.
            Daniel: Implement a sandbox mode with infinite block placement, and handle any edge cases not found in predefined puzzles.

        Week 9:
            Donovan: Confirm that the scope is maintained again, finalize ideas and full scope, continue working with
                        lead developer.
            Zheng: Tutorial system implemented. Help tooltips functional for all block types.
            Cash: Tutorial should be finished. Continue fixing bugs and ensure all test cases and use cases are passed.
            Daniel: Test the puzzles multiple times, have others test them, and continue making more if there's time.

        Week 10:
            Donovan: Overall QA meeting 2, finalize project, ensure all user stories' goals are met, deliver project. 
                        Rid of any other complications in the development process.
            Zheng:  Final QA pass complete and all critical bugs resolved. UX improvements from playtesting implemented.
            Cash: Tie up lose ends, and finalize last resolves. 
            Daniel: Finalize puzzles/levels, look for any last minute exploits that pop up.

    Major Risks:

        Risk 1: Team members lack extensive Godot experience, which may cause implementation delays
            and underestimated feature completion times.
        Risk 2: Block connection logic for representing programming constructs may be too complex to 
            implement intuitively.
        Risk 3: Scope creep from adding non-essential features could result in incomplete core functionality.


    External Feedback:
        When external feedback will be most useful:
            Week 6 after first playable prototype is complete, early enough to make significant changes
            based on feedback, or Week 8 after all core features implemented
        
        How we will get that feedback:
            Recruit 3-5 CS162 students for playtesting, and create feedback forms asking specific questions.

    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        1.  Implement the ability to make functions
        2.  Implement the recursion


===================================================================
Software Architecture
===================================================================

    //////////////////
    Architecture Pattern
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our project uses an event-based architecture in Godot. Systems communicate
        using events rather than direct dependencies, improving modlar design
        and parallel development.

    //////////////////
    Major Components
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Gameplay System:
            Executes block logic and validates puzzle solutions.

        UI System:
            Displays menus, feedback, tutorials, and player input.

        Player System:
            Handles movement, camera control, and interactions.

        Puzzle System:
            Loads levels, sandbox mode, and puzzle rules.

        Data System:
            Saves player progress and settings locally.

    //////////////////
    Component Interfaces
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        UI emits events then Gameplay reacts  
        Gameplay emits events (such as movement or placing blocks) then UI updates  
        Puzzle System emits load events then Game spawns levels  
        Data System listens for save/load events  

    //////////////////
    Data Storage
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Player progress and settings stored locally using JSON.
        Puzzle layouts stored as Godot scenes/resources.

    //////////////////
    Assumptions
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        - Single-player only
        - Windows 10/11 supported
        - No internet required

    //////////////////
    Architecture Decisions
    //////////////////

        Decision 1: Event-Driven vs. Layered Architecture
            Choice: Event-Driven.
            Alternative: Layered Architecture.
            Pros: Layered is highly organized and easy to document.
            Cons: Creates rigid dependencies. Event-driven allows the UI 
                to react asynchronously to gameplay signals, which is 
                more efficient for real-time 3D simulations.

        Decision 2: Event-Driven vs. Microkernel Architecture
            Choice: Event-Driven.
            Alternative: Microkernel Architecture.
            Pros: Microkernel makes every "coding block" a modular plug-in.
            Cons: High initial setup complexity. Event-driven is simpler 
                to implement with Godot’s built-in signal system while 
                maintaining sufficient modularity.

I) Risk Assessment

    Top 5 risks to successful completion of your project

    1) Late implementation. LIkelihood: medium Risk: high. As of now, we haven't spent enough 
       time implementing. This has a high impact because our game will be unfinished. My evidence
       is as follows: so far, we have yet to fully implement any of our classes. Now, we are 
       pushing to get our ideas implemented, in order to prevent the likelihood of this occurring.
       We will implement the basic game flow within the next week to build a foundation. The
       problem has taken effect if we don't have this done. We will take these steps in that case: 
       Designate each person to fully implement a feature by the end of the week. This will give us
       at least 4 features built, and we will need to continue this trajectory to stay on track.

    2) Block placing logic harder than expected. Likelihood: medium, Impact: high. This part of
       the code is likely to be hard to implement. As an integral part to the game, it would have
       a huge impact if left unchecked. To reduce likelihood, we have started watching godot tutorials
       and have compiled a list of a few videos that can help. Detecting the problem will be simple
       because whoever is implementing this part of the code at the time will communicate. We've
       all agreed to communicate issues as important as this. Should this risk occur, we will
       research the necessary implementation details and work on the implementation together. This 
       risk will be identified soon, as we plan on implementing this in the coming weeks.

    3) Blocks don't work properly. Likelihood: High, Impact: High. The blocks are going to take a
       lot of work to properly implement, and we need them to work flawlessly if we want to teach
       beginners. The chance of them not working properly at first is almost guaranteed, so it is
       imperative to plan ahead. To reduce the likelihood, we will have to make sure each block
       follows the guidelines that we've layed out prior. Right now, we have a list of required
       blocks and how they should behave, so we will follow this guide, and test them after
       implementation. To detect the problem, we will run tests on each block. We will do this by
       placing them next to other ones and observing their behavior, and by using our test plan
       below. Should this occur, we plan on following standard debugging procedure for broken blocks,
       and making sure they behave as required (outlined below).

    4) Godot 3D mechanics and engine limitations slow progress. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       None of us have extensive experience building a full 3D game with Godot. While we are confident
       we can learn, unexpected engine limitations or confusing workflows could slow development. This
       could impact our timeline and force us to spend time debugging engine-related issues rather than
       implementing. Evidece: so far, some basic tasks (such as scene organization) have taken longer
       than expected during experimentation. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are keeping 
       our game mechanics simple and relying on Godot’s built-in systems whenever possible rather than 
       creating overly complex custom solutions. We are also sharing resources and tutorials within 
       the team. We will detect this problem if tasks involving Godot repeatedly fall behind schedule or 
       require excessive troubleshooting. If this risk occurs, we will mitigate it by cutting 
       non-essential features and refocusing on core gameplay and learning objectives.

    5) Educational goals are not clearly achieved through gameplay. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       It's possible that the game does not clearly teach introductory programming concepts as intended.
       Our evidence for this risk comes from early discussions where some mechanics felt engaging but did
       not clearly reinforce learning objectives. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are explicitly
       tying each block and level to a specific programming concept and designing levels around 
       those goals. We also plan to add clear visual feedback so players can see the effect of their 
       blocks in real time. We will detect this issue through playtesting, especially by observing whether 
       new players can explain what their block logic is doing. If this risk occurs, we will 
       mitigate it by redesigning levels, adding tutorials or guided prompts, and simplifying 
       mechanics to better emphasize learning outcomes.


II) Project Schedule

    To begin, templates for a baseplate (map with free-roam), a character (including collision), and a template
    block (also with collision) should be made. The baseplate should be big enough so that the player can move,
    if possible, it should also have invisible boundaries.

    After making templates, our team will move forward in developing the movement for the character, as well as 
    desigining very smooth and efficient animations that won't hinder progress in development. The character's
    model must be finished before this step is complete, otherwise the physics and movement will have to be
    changed. Blocks will be implemented with their own placing mechanics within the game as well. Collision
    must be done first in order to prevent unnecessary rendering bugs or issues. As for the baseplate, a simple
    and light texture should be done on it, and the whole area of the baseplate should have invisible dividers
    should be inplemented to prevent players from placing blocks in between lines for simpler gameplay.

    Once those are implemented, other template blocks should be made with labels, without an explicit function. 
    To add on, afull UI for the player should be made to allow the user to interact with a basic templatized 
    world. At this point the player should be able to do the following:
        1. Move around using WASD keys (standard for most 3D games)
        2. Select certain blocks through a UI system (could be a hotbar or scroll wheel, TBD)
        3. Place down the blocks and have them seen rendered properly
        4. The player won't have to adjust where they want the block, the block will be locked with the grid
        5. The player has other movement capabilities (jumping, crouching, TBD)
        6. Leave the baseplate and enter a new one (for the testing process only)
    During this stage in development, it would be an amazing idea to create some test cases and testing suites
    to ensure that the progress made thus far isn't for nothing. Tests like these will be difficult to create
    as our team plans on using godot, however our team will persevere through that and find some way to test
    eveyrhting mentioned previously.

    Now that a basic UI system has been implemented, our team will then move on towards creating functional
    blocks that the player can interact with. An example follows: 
        For loop block: Possibly have a UI that allows the player to change the index start, index end,
                        and how much it increments by each time.
    Other blocks have yet to be decided, but when set up, they all should have their own test suites and
    fuzzes. This will ensure that the functionality of each block matches the idea we had, and that each
    block will work alongside with other connected blocks.

    One of the most difficult steps after is to start using all the templates our team created to make
    interesting and intriguing puzzles that can be solved by someone new to programming. Tests will be
    even harder to create on this step, which means we'll have to be more cautious when creating the map
    and other functions. Each puzzle should have specified bounds, and creative ideas could be integrated
    into the design if time isn't short. This stage should only be started once all tests have ran 
    successfully and no more bugs have been found. If bugs during an earlier section of the schedule 
    have been rediscovered or discovered in general, all work on current work and work after the
    component that has the bug will be halted, and more tests will be done on the improper component.

    Now that all those have been tested, the puzzles will enter a final testing phase, and after this,
    the stretch goals will be implemented one by one to increase the quality of our product.

    Overall Timeline:
        2026-02-01 - 2026-02-07: Finish architecture and design process, and begin the implementation
                                 phase of development.
        2026-02-08 - 2026-02-14: Use the development cycle of a software to test and evolve the product
                                 through the player animations, hitboxes, and collision aspects. Fully
                                 complete tempaltes for the world and characters.
        2026-02-15 - 2026-02-21: Complete player movement, physics, and block placing. Remake new tests
                                 and using a full coverage to test for small defects in our software.
        2026-02-22 - 2026-02-28: Fully implement in-scope blocks with programming basics (for loops, 
                                 if and else statements, TBD). Continue with testing.
        2026-03-01 - 2026-03-07: Realize scope and create puzzles, the last week will be saved for
                                 the most amount of testing and evolving of the product, as well as
                                 scope changes and solidifying the goal.
        2026-03-08 - 2026-03-14: Once scope is realized, ensure all tests are passed before developing
                                 extra stretch goals to improve the quality of the product.

    Through this schedule, our team will be able to work smoothly and realize our deadlines more easily.

III) Team Structure

    The knowledge on team structure and our team roles are going to stay consistent as they have been
    above this section. See the 'Team Process Description' subtitle of the 'Project Description' for 
    more clarification on what each member does, and their role in the project.

IV) Test Plan & Bugs

    We plan on significantly testing our block code works and our loops work. These serve as the baseline
    of the entire game, and ensuring that they are working perfectly is necessary for the software to 
    function. To test this, our team is going to devise multiple solutions to each puzzle, and ensure that
    said solutions achieve the correct result. We also plan on testing edge cases that users could conjure
    up, such as running permanently iterative or recursive code, and designing a solution to this.

V) Documentation Plan

    Our team plans on delivering documentation for keybinds, a user manual, and an information doc on what
    each block does and what it represents in coding languages. We will also have help text available with
    puzzles that users might find particularly challenging. We aim to use this to allow users to never find
    themselves unsure of what to do, as we want to help our users on their journey of learning the 
    fundamentals of programming languages.
