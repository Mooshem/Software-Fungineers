Project Description
===================================================================   

    //////////////////
    Abstract
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our team is developing a 3D game simulation for visualizing and practicing
        coding. We will create a 3D space for users to learn how to code, using blocks
        and lines as functions and commands. This will allow a generation that grew up 
        playing videogames to learn how to program in an environment that they are
        familiar with.

    //////////////////
    Goal
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The problem that our team is solving is teaching new users how to program. Our
        unique way of solving this problem is relating these users towards something that
        they are familiar with; video games. 

    //////////////////
    Current Practice
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Currently, learning how to code stems from lectures and hands-off teaching. Our aim 
        is to revolutionize this process, allowing people to learn in an effecient manner.

    //////////////////
    Novelty
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our approach is novel because it’s similar to a video game. This generation of students 
        has grown up playing video games, and would likely find it more helpful than current options.

    //////////////////
    Effects
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Beginners to programming would find it useful to visualize what is actually 
        happening with their code. The majority of our team works as TA’s, and we’ve 
        noticed a gap in fundamental knowledge that we believe visualization can help 
        bridge.

    //////////////////
    Use Case
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        CL - A user wants to get into programming, but they are unsure where to start. They will
             use our game to learn how programming 

            Actor: Cranjis McBasketball
            Triggers: Mr McBasketball doesn't know where to start learning programming, and wants 
                      something not overwhelming.
            Preconditions: 
                - Mr McBasketball has a need for learning programming
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
                - Mr McBasketball successfully learns the fundamentals of programming so he can
                  apply it to a language of his choice
                - Mr McBasketball successfully completes the puzzles offered in the game
            List of steps (success scenario): 
                1. Mr McBasketball opens the game
                2. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 1
                3. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 2
                4. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 3
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario:
                - Mr McBasketball already understands functions, so he stops at puzzle 2
                - Mr McBasketball replays a puzzle that he thinks he could solve better
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
                - Mr McBasketball does not complete puzzle 1, which doesn't allow him to 
                  continue to puzzle 2

        ZC - A user has tried programming before, but they can't understand how their code works. 
             They will use the game to learn how their code works and implement this 
             knowledge into real-world programming.

            Actor: Alvin Chipmunk, a high school student who has tried to learn programming through
            YouTube tutorials
            Triggers: Alvin writes code that compiles but doesn't produce expected results, leading to frustration
            Preconditions: 
                - Alvin has basic knowledge of programming syntax like variables
                - Alvin has the game installed and accessible
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
                - Alvin successfully visualizes how loops and conditionals execute step by step
                - Alvin understands why his previous code didn't work as expected
                - Alvin can apply this visualization knowledge to debug real code
            List of steps (success scenario): 
                - Alvin opens the game and selects a "Loop Visualization" puzzle
                - Alvin places blocks to build a for-loop structure
                - Alvin connects conditional blocks within the loop
                - Alvin runs the game and watches the 3D visualization execute each step at a time
                - Alvin observes how the loop counter changes and how conditionals affect execution flow
                - Alvin pauses execution at key points to examine block states
                - Alvin completes the puzzle and gains understanding of loop mechanics
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
                - Alvin replays the visualization at different speeds to better understand quick executions
                - Alvin modifies the puzzle parameters to test edge cases
                - Alvin uses the knowledge to fix a bug in his actual code
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
                - Alvin cant understand the block metaphor and needs to complete a tutorial first
                - The visualization is too fast or slow and Alvin can't adjust the speed
                - Alvin's computer doesn't meet the minimum requirements and the game lags, preventing smooth visualization

        DT - A user doesn't learn well by sitting through tutorials and lectures, and wants to 
             begin writing programs. The user will use our game to teach themselves how to 
             program in a way that works for their brain. 

            Actor: Yin Chen
            Triggers: 
                - Yin keeps watching coding materials, wanting to learn programming at a 
                  young age, but all tutorial videos are unamusing and disinteresting.
            Preconditions: 
                - Yin wants an interactive way, preferably a game, where he can learn how
                  to program.
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
                - Yin finds it fun and challenging to complete each puzzle, learning the 
                  basics along the way
            List of steps (success scenario): 
                1. Yin downloads the game and plays it
                2. Yin works through trial and error, seeing how he directly changes the
                   result and seeing how each change he makes affects the program
                3. Yin continues playing the game, wanting to learn more about programming
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
                - Yin uses the game to help him get through online tutorials much easier
                  due to a larger amount of background knowledge on programming
                - Yin begins to widen his programming knowledge at a much earlier age than
                  others might
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
                - Yin can't solve any puzzles that the game prevents, which might shut him
                  out from programming altogether
                - Yin might not find the game interesting enough to continue playing/learning

        DM - A user wants to switch careers, but doesn't have time to enroll in classes to learn
             how to program. The user will use our game to teach themselves how to program in their
             free time.

            Actor: 
            Triggers: 
            Preconditions: 
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
            List of steps (success scenario): 
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 

    //////////////////
    Non-Functional Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The program will run without lagging, creating a seamless user experience.

        The program will start withen 3 seconds of running the program.

        The program will be able to support 1 user.

        New users must be able to complete the first puzzle within 10 minutes.

        Must run on integrated graphics cards.

    //////////////////
    External Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The application must run on Windows 10/11

        All third-party libraries and 3D graphics frameworks used must have permissive open-source 
        licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, or similar) to allow free distribution to educational institutions
        
        The programming concepts taught (variables, conditionals, loops, functions) must align with standard 
        CS curriculum frameworks

    //////////////////
    Technical Approach
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our team intends on using a technical 3D graphics software, Godot,
        to complete this project. We will also be using Visual Studio code for 
        writing the program. 

    //////////////////
    Risks
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The largest risk that our team forsees is not fully being able to distinguish 
        conditional statements for a user to distinguish it from other conditional 
        statements. To solve this risk we will focus on understandable UX design.

    Team Process Description
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    
    Software Toolset:

        Tool: Godot 
        Justification: Open-source 3D game engine with MIT license meeting our external requirements. 
            It also has built-in 3D tools and visual scripting.

        Tool: Visual Studio Code
        Justification: IDE we're familiar with, and has GDScript extensions and version control integration.

        Tool: GitHub
        Justification: Essential for team collaboration. Provides issue tracking and project management tools.

    Team Member Roles:

        Donovan Thach - Project Manager
            Why this role is needed: Big projects with tight deadlines requires someone to ensure that the team
                not only stays on track, but also that the project will be deliverable by the assumed date that
                it is due.
            Why Donovan is suited: Experience with many teams that required leadership or a constant drive.

        Zheng Chen - UX/Design Lead and Quality Assurance
            Why this role is needed: Educational games require intuitive interfaces so users focus on
                learning programming concepts rather than struggling with controls.
            Why Zheng is suited: Experience with TAing reveals and provides direct insight to common student
                struggles with programming concepts.

        Cash Limberg - Lead Developer
            Why this role is needed: We need a lead developer due to the challange of developing this specific
                game, and the challanges that it poses to work with a group of people. Giving the group a lead 
                developer allows for all the programmers in the group to be directed and understand their  
                job in the team.
            Why Cash is suited: Cash has TAed before, leading a group of people through complex coding problems
                and solutions. Cash has demonstrated that he is capable of understanding others' programs, and 
                quickly diagnosing potential risks that those problems can cause if left untreated.

            Zheng: QA testing complete for puzzle 1. Bug list documented with priorities assigned.
            Cash: Block implementation should be finalized. Begin the development of the puzzles. 
            Daniel:

         Week 8:
            Donovan: Ensure members with bugs aligning to their roles have been resolved and ensure project scope will
                        be within the deadline.
            Zheng: UI polish and refinements based on Week 6 playtest feedback. All visual elements finalized.
            Cash: Ensure all code is working seamlessly. Fix potential bug problems and ensure that all test cases
                        and use cases are passed. Work on tutorial system.
            Daniel:

        Week 9:
            Donovan: Confirm that the scope is maintained again, finalize ideas and full scope, continue working with
                        lead developer.
            Zheng: Tutorial system implemented. Help tooltips functional for all block types.

            Cash: Tie up lose ends, and finalize last resolves. 
            Daniel:

    Major Risks:

        Risk 1: Team members lack extensive Godot experience, which may cause implementation delays
            and underestimated feature completion times.
        Risk 2: Block connection logic for representing programming constructs may be too complex to 
            implement intuitively.
        Risk 3: Scope creep from adding non-essential features could result in incomplete core functionality.


    External Feedback:
        When external feedback will be most useful:
            Week 6 after first playable prototype is complete, early enough to make significant changes
            based on feedback, or Week 8 after all core features implemented
        
        How we will get that feedback:
            Recruit 3-5 CS162 students for playtesting, and create feedback forms asking specific questions.
