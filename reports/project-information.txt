Project Description
===================================================================   

    //////////////////
    Abstract
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our team is developing a 3D game simulation for visualizing and practicing
        coding. We will create a 3D space for users to learn how to code, using blocks
        and lines as functions and commands. This will allow a generation that grew up 
        playing videogames to learn how to program in an environment that they are
        familiar with.

    //////////////////
    Goal
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The problem that our team is solving is teaching new users how to program. Our
        unique way of solving this problem is relating these users towards something that
        they are familiar with; video games. 

    //////////////////
    Current Practice
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Currently, learning how to code stems from lectures and hands-off teaching. Our aim 
        is to revolutionize this process, allowing people to learn in an effecient manner.

    //////////////////
    Novelty
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our approach is novel because it’s similar to a video game. This generation of students 
        has grown up playing video games, and would likely find it more helpful than current options.

    //////////////////
    Effects
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Beginners to programming would find it useful to visualize what is actually 
        happening with their code. The majority of our team works as TA’s, and we’ve 
        noticed a gap in fundamental knowledge that we believe visualization can help 
        bridge.

    //////////////////
    Use Case
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        CL - A user wants to get into programming, but they are unsure where to start. They will
             use our game to learn how programming 

            Actor: Cranjis McBasketball
            Triggers: 
            Preconditions: 
                - Mr McBasketball has a need for learning programming
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
                - Mr McBasketball successfully learns the fundamentals of programming so he can
                  apply it to a language of his choice
                - Mr McBasketball successfully completes the puzzles offered in the game
            List of steps (success scenario): 
                1. Mr McBasketball opens the game
                2. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 1
                3. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 2
                4. Mr McBasketball completes puzzle 3
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario:
                - Mr McBasketball already understands functions, so he stops at puzzle 2
                - Mr McBasketball replays a puzzle that he thinks he could solve better
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
                - Mr McBasketball does not complete puzzle 1, which doesn't allow him to 
                  continue to puzzle 2

        ZC - A user has tried programming before, but they can't understand how their code works. 
             They will use the game to learn how their code works and implement this 
             knowledge into real-world programming.

            Actor: 
            Triggers: 
            Preconditions: 
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
            List of steps (success scenario): 
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 

        DT - A user doesn't learn well by sitting through tutorials and lectures, and wants to 
             begin writing programs. The user will use our game to teach themselves how to 
             program in a way that works for their brain. 

            Actor: 
            Triggers: 
            Preconditions: 
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
            List of steps (success scenario): 
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 

        DM - A user wants to switch careers, but doesn't have time to enroll in classes to learn
             how to program. The user will use our game to teach themselves how to program in their
             free time.

            Actor: 
            Triggers: 
            Preconditions: 
            Postconditions (success scenario): 
            List of steps (success scenario): 
            Extensions/variations of the success scenario: 
            Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 

    //////////////////
    Non-Functional Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The program will run without lagging, creating a seamless user experience.

        The program will start withen 3 seconds of running the program.

        The program will be able to support 1 user.

    //////////////////
    Non-Functional Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The application must run on Windows 10/11

        All third-party libraries and 3D graphics frameworks used must have permissive open-source 
        licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, or similar) to allow free distribution to educational institutions
        
        The programming concepts taught (variables, conditionals, loops, functions) must align with standard 
        CS curriculum frameworks

    //////////////////
    Technical Approach
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our team intends on using a technical 3D graphics software, Godot,
        to complete this project. We will also be using Visual Studio code for 
        writing the program. 

    //////////////////
    Risks
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The largest risk that our team forsees is not fully being able to distinguish 
        conditional statements for a user to distinguish it from other conditional 
        statements. To solve this risk we will focus on understandable UX design.
