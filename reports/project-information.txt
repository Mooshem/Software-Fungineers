Project Description
===================================================================   

    //////////////////
    Abstract
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Our team is developing a 3D game simulation for visualizing and practicing
        coding. We will create a 3D space for users to learn the fundamentals to 
        programming, using blocks and lines as functions and commands. This will 
        allow a generation that grew up playing videogames to learn how to 
        program in an environment that they are familiar with.

    //////////////////
    Goal
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The problem that our team is solving is teaching new users how to program. Our
        unique way of solving this problem is relating these users towards something that
        they are familiar with; video games. 

    //////////////////
    Current Practice
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        There are two main ways that this problem is solved currently. Firstly, coding games like
        Coddy where the aim is to teach specific syntax of languages in a game format. Secondly,
        other 2d block coding platforms like Scratch that have less emphasis on the 'game' aspect,
        and more on a creative sandbox or tool for developers.

    //////////////////
    Novelty
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The novelty of our project comes from the 3d space that users will interact with and the
        puzzles that will be specifically designed for beginners who have never coded before.
        Coding games like Coddy usually specify a syntax (i.e. Java or C), but our project uses block
        coding to avoid the problem of beginners simply memorizing syntax. Taking inspiration from
        Scratch as a block coding tool, we will implement our project in 3d which adds another level
        of interactivity and visualization. This is ideal because we want our users to see their
        code working in real time step by step rather than staring at lines of code.

    //////////////////
    Effects
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Beginners to programming would find it useful to visualize what is actually 
        happening with their code. The majority of our team works as TA’s, and we’ve 
        noticed a gap in fundamental knowledge that we believe visualization can help 
        bridge.

    Use Cases
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

######################################
    Daniel Martin - Use Case: Sandbox Mode

        As a user, I want to be able to experiment with combinations 
        of blocks not taught by the tutorial/puzzles so that I can 
        further understand the way different pieces of code interact.
        
        Actors: User, System
        Triggers: User has completed all puzzles and is left with unanswered questions or curious about other interactions
        Preconditions: 
            - User has completed all puzzles
            - User has navigated to and opened the sandbox mode
                    
        Postconditions (success scenario): 
            - System stores sandbox data for user to come back to
            - System handles wide variety of block interactions
            - User can develop and visualize a wide variety of 
              potential programs, beyond what the tutorial and 
              puzzles offer.
        
        List of steps (success scenario):
            - User completes all puzzles
            - User navigates to Sandbox mode
            - User places up to 25 blocks, and views working interactions
            - User leaves sandbox mode
                    
        Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios: 
            - Block interactions are not robust: Placing in unplanned ways leads to bugs.
            - Placing too many blocks stresses resources too highly, program crashes.

    //////////////////
    Non-Functional Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The program will run without lagging, creating a seamless user experience.

        The program will start within 3 seconds of running the program.

        The program will be able to support 1 user.

        New users must be able to complete the first puzzle within 10 minutes.

        Must run on integrated graphics cards.

    //////////////////
    External Requirements
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        The application will be downloaded through an external website, and the application will be ran on
        a Windows OS, on Windows 10/11, or alternatively a Linus or MacOS system. 4GB Ram required, and a
        minimum of at least an integrated graphics card.

        All third-party libraries and 3D graphics frameworks used must have permissive open-source 
        licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, or similar) to allow free distribution to educational institutions
        
        The programming concepts taught (variables, conditionals, loops, functions) must align with standard 
        CS curriculum frameworks

    //////////////////
    Technical Approach
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        We have decided to go with an event-driven architecture as it lends itself well to Godot's built-in
        signal system. We will have player actions (such as walking, placing a block, etc.) act as events
        that drive the rest of the program. To solve the initial problem of teaching absolute beginners the
        fundamentals of programming, we wwill not be teaching any language in particular. Instead, we plan on
        implementing a 'block code' language where conditions, variables, and other pieces of a program will be
        implemented as physical blocks that the user can place and manipulate. The reason why this approach
        is ideal is that users will be able to interact with their code more freely. We plan on implementing a
        signal system where signals will travel through wires, and users can physically see the control flow
        of their program. The block code style has worked successfully in the past with projects like Scratch,
        but we believe a 3d environment will make it even easier to understand for complete beginners. Our team
        is mostly composed of ULAs for intro programming courses, so to make sure the content is educational, we
        will work together and agree upon which content to add or remove from in-game puzzles to challenge the
        user at an appropriate level. We will use the Godot game engine to implement our game.

    //////////////////
    Risks
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

    1) Late implementation. LIkelihood: medium Risk: high. As of now, we haven't spent enough 
       time implementing. This has a high impact because our game will be unfinished. My evidence
       is as follows: so far, we have yet to fully implement any of our classes. Now, we are 
       pushing to get our ideas implemented, in order to prevent the likelihood of this occurring.
       We will implement the basic game flow within the next week to build a foundation. The
       problem has taken effect if we don't have this done. We will take these steps in that case: 
       Designate each person to fully implement a feature by the end of the week. This will give us
       at least 4 features built, and we will need to continue this trajectory to stay on track.

    2) Block placing logic harder than expected. Likelihood: medium, Impact: high. This part of
       the code is likely to be hard to implement. As an integral part to the game, it would have
       a huge impact if left unchecked. To reduce likelihood, we have started watching godot tutorials
       and have compiled a list of a few videos that can help. Detecting the problem will be simple
       because whoever is implementing this part of the code at the time will communicate. We've
       all agreed to communicate issues as important as this. Should this risk occur, we will
       research the necessary implementation details and work on the implementation together. This 
       risk will be identified soon, as we plan on implementing this in the coming weeks.

    3) Blocks don't work properly. Likelihood: High, Impact: High. The blocks are going to take a
       lot of work to properly implement, and we need them to work flawlessly if we want to teach
       beginners. The chance of them not working properly at first is almost guaranteed, so it is
       imperative to plan ahead. To reduce the likelihood, we will have to make sure each block
       follows the guidelines that we've layed out prior. Right now, we have a list of required
       blocks and how they should behave, so we will follow this guide, and test them after
       implementation. To detect the problem, we will run tests on each block. We will do this by
       placing them next to other ones and observing their behavior, and by using our test plan
       below. Should this occur, we plan on following standard debugging procedure for broken blocks,
       and making sure they behave as required (outlined below).

    4) Godot 3D mechanics and engine limitations slow progress. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       None of us have extensive experience building a full 3D game with Godot. While we are confident
       we can learn, unexpected engine limitations or confusing workflows could slow development. This
       could impact our timeline and force us to spend time debugging engine-related issues rather than
       implementing. Evidece: so far, some basic tasks (such as scene organization) have taken longer
       than expected during experimentation. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are keeping 
       our game mechanics simple and relying on Godot’s built-in systems whenever possible rather than 
       creating overly complex custom solutions. We are also sharing resources and tutorials within 
       the team. We will detect this problem if tasks involving Godot repeatedly fall behind schedule or 
       require excessive troubleshooting. If this risk occurs, we will mitigate it by cutting 
       non-essential features and refocusing on core gameplay and learning objectives.

    5) Educational goals are not clearly achieved through gameplay. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       It's possible that the game does not clearly teach introductory programming concepts as intended.
       Our evidence for this risk comes from early discussions where some mechanics felt engaging but did
       not clearly reinforce learning objectives. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are explicitly
       tying each block and level to a specific programming concept and designing levels around 
       those goals. We also plan to add clear visual feedback so players can see the effect of their 
       blocks in real time. We will detect this issue through playtesting, especially by observing whether 
       new players can explain what their block logic is doing. If this risk occurs, we will 
       mitigate it by redesigning levels, adding tutorials or guided prompts, and simplifying 
       mechanics to better emphasize learning outcomes.

    Software Toolset:

        Tool: Godot 
        Justification: Open-source 3D game engine with MIT license meeting our external requirements. 
            It also has built-in 3D tools and visual scripting.

        Tool: Visual Studio Code
        Justification: IDE we're familiar with, and has GDScript extensions and version control integration.

        Tool: GitHub
        Justification: Essential for team collaboration. Provides issue tracking and project management tools.

    Team Member Roles:

        Donovan Thach - Project Manager
            Why this role is needed: Big projects with tight deadlines requires someone to ensure that the team
                not only stays on track, but also that the project will be deliverable by the assumed date that
                it is due.
            Why Donovan is suited: Experience with many teams that required leadership or a constant drive.

        Zheng Chen - UX/Design Lead and Quality Assurance
            Why this role is needed: Educational games require intuitive interfaces so users focus on
                learning programming concepts rather than struggling with controls.
            Why Zheng is suited: Experience with TAing reveals and provides direct insight to common student
                struggles with programming concepts.

        Cash Limberg - Lead Developer
            Why this role is needed: We need a lead developer due to the challenge of developing this specific
                game, and the challenges that it poses to work with a group of people. Giving the group a lead 
                developer allows for all the programmers in the group to be directed and understand their  
                job in the team.
            Why Cash is suited: Cash has TAed before, leading a group of people through complex coding problems
                and solutions. Cash has demonstrated that he is capable of understanding others' programs, and 
                quickly diagnosing potential risks that those problems can cause if left untreated.

        Daniel Martin - Game Design Lead
            Why this role is needed: As an educational game, we need to ensure that the content is appropriate.
                This means that the overall game loop must be engaging, but more importantly, it needs to
                actually teach players coding fundamentals. This role ensure that both of those criteria is met.
            Why Daniel is suited: Daniel is a ULA for intro CS classes, and has experience with common pitfalls
                that trap beginner programers. Through this experience, Daniel has learned what students typically
                struggle with and what needs to be emphasized for the game to be educational.

       blocks and how they should behave, so we will follow this guide, and test them after
       implementation. To detect the problem, we will run tests on each block. We will do this by
       placing them next to other ones and observing their behavior, and by using our test plan
       below. Should this occur, we plan on following standard debugging procedure for broken blocks,
       and making sure they behave as required (outlined below).

    4) Godot 3D mechanics and engine limitations slow progress. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       None of us have extensive experience building a full 3D game with Godot. While we are confident
       we can learn, unexpected engine limitations or confusing workflows could slow development. This
       could impact our timeline and force us to spend time debugging engine-related issues rather than
       implementing. Evidece: so far, some basic tasks (such as scene organization) have taken longer
       than expected during experimentation. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are keeping 
       our game mechanics simple and relying on Godot’s built-in systems whenever possible rather than 
       creating overly complex custom solutions. We are also sharing resources and tutorials within 
       the team. We will detect this problem if tasks involving Godot repeatedly fall behind schedule or 
       require excessive troubleshooting. If this risk occurs, we will mitigate it by cutting 
       non-essential features and refocusing on core gameplay and learning objectives.

    5) Educational goals are not clearly achieved through gameplay. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       It's possible that the game does not clearly teach introductory programming concepts as intended.
       Our evidence for this risk comes from early discussions where some mechanics felt engaging but did
       not clearly reinforce learning objectives. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are explicitly
       tying each block and level to a specific programming concept and designing levels around 
       those goals. We also plan to add clear visual feedback so players can see the effect of their 
       blocks in real time. We will detect this issue through playtesting, especially by observing whether 
       new players can explain what their block logic is doing. If this risk occurs, we will 
       mitigate it by redesigning levels, adding tutorials or guided prompts, and simplifying 
       mechanics to better emphasize learning outcomes.


    External Feedback:
        When external feedback will be most useful:
            After first playable prototype is complete (likely in weeks 7-8), early enough to make significant changes
            based on feedback, or Week 8 after all core features implemented
        
        How we will get that feedback:
            Recruit non-programmer friends and family for playtesting, and create feedback forms asking specific questions.

    Architecture Decisions
    //////////////////

        Decision 1: Event-Driven vs. Layered Architecture
            Choice: Event-Driven.
            Alternative: Layered Architecture.
            Pros: Layered is highly organized and easy to document.
            Cons: Creates rigid dependencies. Event-driven allows the UI 
                to react asynchronously to gameplay signals, which is 
                more efficient for real-time 3D simulations.

        Decision 2: Event-Driven vs. Microkernel Architecture
            Choice: Event-Driven.
            Alternative: Microkernel Architecture.
            Pros: Microkernel makes every "coding block" a modular plug-in.
            Cons: High initial setup complexity. Event-driven is simpler 
                to implement with Godot’s built-in signal system while 
                maintaining sufficient modularity.

I) Risk Assessment

    Top 5 risks to successful completion of your project

    1) Late implementation. LIkelihood: medium Risk: high. As of now, we haven't spent enough 
       time implementing. This has a high impact because our game will be unfinished. My evidence
       is as follows: so far, we have yet to fully implement any of our classes. Now, we are 
       pushing to get our ideas implemented, in order to prevent the likelihood of this occurring.
       We will implement the basic game flow within the next week to build a foundation. The
       problem has taken effect if we don't have this done. We will take these steps in that case: 
       Designate each person to fully implement a feature by the end of the week. This will give us
       at least 4 features built, and we will need to continue this trajectory to stay on track.

    2) Block placing logic harder than expected. Likelihood: medium, Impact: high. This part of
       the code is likely to be hard to implement. As an integral part to the game, it would have
       a huge impact if left unchecked. To reduce likelihood, we have started watching godot tutorials
       and have compiled a list of a few videos that can help. Detecting the problem will be simple
       because whoever is implementing this part of the code at the time will communicate. We've
       all agreed to communicate issues as important as this. Should this risk occur, we will
       research the necessary implementation details and work on the implementation together. This 
       risk will be identified soon, as we plan on implementing this in the coming weeks.

    3) Blocks don't work properly. Likelihood: High, Impact: High. The blocks are going to take a
       lot of work to properly implement, and we need them to work flawlessly if we want to teach
       beginners. The chance of them not working properly at first is almost guaranteed, so it is
       imperative to plan ahead. To reduce the likelihood, we will have to make sure each block
       follows the guidelines that we've layed out prior. Right now, we have a list of required
       blocks and how they should behave, so we will follow this guide, and test them after
       implementation. To detect the problem, we will run tests on each block. We will do this by
       placing them next to other ones and observing their behavior, and by using our test plan
       below. Should this occur, we plan on following standard debugging procedure for broken blocks,
       and making sure they behave as required (outlined below).

    4) Godot 3D mechanics and engine limitations slow progress. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       None of us have extensive experience building a full 3D game with Godot. While we are confident
       we can learn, unexpected engine limitations or confusing workflows could slow development. This
       could impact our timeline and force us to spend time debugging engine-related issues rather than
       implementing. Evidece: so far, some basic tasks (such as scene organization) have taken longer
       than expected during experimentation. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are keeping 
       our game mechanics simple and relying on Godot’s built-in systems whenever possible rather than 
       creating overly complex custom solutions. We are also sharing resources and tutorials within 
       the team. We will detect this problem if tasks involving Godot repeatedly fall behind schedule or 
       require excessive troubleshooting. If this risk occurs, we will mitigate it by cutting 
       non-essential features and refocusing on core gameplay and learning objectives.

    5) Educational goals are not clearly achieved through gameplay. Likelihood: medium, Impact: medium-high.
       It's possible that the game does not clearly teach introductory programming concepts as intended.
       Our evidence for this risk comes from early discussions where some mechanics felt engaging but did
       not clearly reinforce learning objectives. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, we are explicitly
       tying each block and level to a specific programming concept and designing levels around 
       those goals. We also plan to add clear visual feedback so players can see the effect of their 
       blocks in real time. We will detect this issue through playtesting, especially by observing whether 
       new players can explain what their block logic is doing. If this risk occurs, we will 
       mitigate it by redesigning levels, adding tutorials or guided prompts, and simplifying 
       mechanics to better emphasize learning outcomes.


II) Project Schedule

    To begin, templates for a baseplate (map with free-roam), a character (including collision), and a template
    block (also with collision) should be made. The baseplate should be big enough so that the player can move,
    if possible, it should also have invisible boundaries.

    After making templates, our team will move forward in developing the movement for the character, as well as 
    desigining very smooth and efficient animations that won't hinder progress in development. The character's
    model must be finished before this step is complete, otherwise the physics and movement will have to be
    changed. Blocks will be implemented with their own placing mechanics within the game as well. Collision
    must be done first in order to prevent unnecessary rendering bugs or issues. As for the baseplate, a simple
    and light texture should be done on it, and the whole area of the baseplate should have invisible dividers
    should be inplemented to prevent players from placing blocks in between lines for simpler gameplay.

    Once those are implemented, other template blocks should be made with labels, without an explicit function. 
    To add on, afull UI for the player should be made to allow the user to interact with a basic templatized 
    world. At this point the player should be able to do the following:
        1. Move around using WASD keys (standard for most 3D games)
        2. Select certain blocks through a UI system (could be a hotbar or scroll wheel, TBD)
        3. Place down the blocks and have them seen rendered properly
        4. The player won't have to adjust where they want the block, the block will be locked with the grid
        5. The player has other movement capabilities (jumping, crouching, TBD)
        6. Leave the baseplate and enter a new one (for the testing process only)
    During this stage in development, it would be an amazing idea to create some test cases and testing suites
    to ensure that the progress made thus far isn't for nothing. Tests like these will be difficult to create
    as our team plans on using godot, however our team will persevere through that and find some way to test
    eveyrhting mentioned previously.

    Now that a basic UI system has been implemented, our team will then move on towards creating functional
    blocks that the player can interact with. An example follows: 
        For loop block: Possibly have a UI that allows the player to change the index start, index end,
                        and how much it increments by each time.
    Other blocks have yet to be decided, but when set up, they all should have their own test suites and
    fuzzes. This will ensure that the functionality of each block matches the idea we had, and that each
    block will work alongside with other connected blocks.

    One of the most difficult steps after is to start using all the templates our team created to make
    interesting and intriguing puzzles that can be solved by someone new to programming. Tests will be
    even harder to create on this step, which means we'll have to be more cautious when creating the map
    and other functions. Each puzzle should have specified bounds, and creative ideas could be integrated
    into the design if time isn't short. This stage should only be started once all tests have ran 
    successfully and no more bugs have been found. If bugs during an earlier section of the schedule 
    have been rediscovered or discovered in general, all work on current work and work after the
    component that has the bug will be halted, and more tests will be done on the improper component.

    Now that all those have been tested, the puzzles will enter a final testing phase, and after this,
    the stretch goals will be implemented one by one to increase the quality of our product.

    Overall Timeline:
        2026-02-01 - 2026-02-07: Finish architecture and design process, and begin the implementation
                                 phase of development.
        2026-02-08 - 2026-02-14: Use the development cycle of a software to test and evolve the product
                                 through the player animations, hitboxes, and collision aspects. Fully
                                 complete tempaltes for the world and characters.
        2026-02-15 - 2026-02-21: Complete player movement, physics, and block placing. Remake new tests
                                 and using a full coverage to test for small defects in our software.
        2026-02-22 - 2026-02-28: Fully implement in-scope blocks with programming basics (for loops, 
                                 if and else statements, TBD). Continue with testing.
        2026-03-01 - 2026-03-07: Realize scope and create puzzles, the last week will be saved for
                                 the most amount of testing and evolving of the product, as well as
                                 scope changes and solidifying the goal.
        2026-03-08 - 2026-03-14: Once scope is realized, ensure all tests are passed before developing
                                 extra stretch goals to improve the quality of the product.

    Through this schedule, our team will be able to work smoothly and realize our deadlines more easily.

III) Team Structure

    The knowledge on team structure and our team roles are going to stay consistent as they have been
    above this section. See the 'Team Process Description' subtitle of the 'Project Description' for 
    more clarification on what each member does, and their role in the project.

IV) Test Plan & Bugs

    We plan on significantly testing our block code works and our loops work.  To test this, our team is 
    going to devise multiple solutions to each puzzle, and ensure that said solutions achieve the correct 
    result. We also plan on testing edge cases that users could conjure up, such as running permanently 
    iterative or recursive code, and designing a solution to this.

V) Documentation Plan

    Our team plans on delivering documentation for keybinds, a user manual, and an information doc on what
    each block does and what it represents in coding languages, and help text for each puzzle.
