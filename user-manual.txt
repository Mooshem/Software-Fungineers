Coding Cubed - User Manual

========================================
1) High-Level Description
========================================
Coding Cubed is a 3D educational game project designed for beginners who want to learn
programming fundamentals in an interactive environment.

Players move in a 3D world and place code-like blocks to represent program behavior.
The intended full experience includes tutorial-guided learning, puzzle levels, and
a sandbox mode for experimentation.

Current implemented focus:
- 3D movement and camera controls
- Block placement and block breaking in a test world

Work in progress (WIP):
- Full puzzle progression
- Tutorial flow
- Expanded block logic (variables, conditionals, loops)

========================================
2) Installation
========================================
Distribution status:
- Public itch.io release is WIP.
- For now, run from source using Godot 4.6.

- Operating system: Windows 10/11 or macOS

Install steps (source build):
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Godot 4.6.
3. Import the `coding-cubed` folder as a project.
4. Wait for project import to complete.

========================================
3) Running the Software
========================================
From source:
1. Open the imported project in Godot.
2. Press Play in the Godot editor.
3. The default scene loads into the test world.

Prebuilt binaries (WIP):
- Windows executable and macOS app packaging are in progress through CI exports.

========================================
4) How to Use the Software
========================================
Current controls:
- Move: W / A / S / D
- Jump: Space
- Run: Shift
- Place block: Right Mouse Button
- Break block (hold): Left Mouse Button

Current gameplay flow:
1. Start in the test world.
2. Move around and place blocks on valid surfaces.
3. Hold left click on a block to break it.
4. Experiment with layout and movement.

Planned flow (WIP):
- Tutorial level
- Sequential puzzle levels
- Sandbox mode after progression

========================================
5) How to Report a Bug
